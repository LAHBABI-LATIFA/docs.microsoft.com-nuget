# NuGet Error NU1107

<pre>Version conflict detected for 'PackageA'. Install/reference 'PackageA' v4.0.0 directly to resolve this issue.<br/>  'PackageB' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 3.5.0)<br/>  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 4.0.0)</pre>

### Issue
Unable to resolve dependency constraints between packages. Two different packages are asking for two different versions of 'PackageA'. The project needs to choose which version of 'PackageA' to use.

### Solution
Install/reference 'PackageA' directly (in the project file) with the exact version that you choose.
Generally, picking the higher version is the right choice.

### Note
Early versions of Visual Studio 2017 may have reported this as a warning (NU1607).

# NuGet Error NU1201

<pre>Project 'ProjectA' is not compatible with 'TargetFramework'. Project 'ProjectA' supports:<br/>  - 'TargetFrameworkA'<br/>  - 'TargetFrameworkB'</pre>

### Issue

### Solution
Change the project's target framework to an equal or lower version than the consuming project.

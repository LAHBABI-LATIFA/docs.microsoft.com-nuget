# dotnet commands

The `dotnet` command-line interface, which runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, provides a number of essential nuget.exe commands as listed below. If dotnet satisfies your needs, it's not necessary to use `nuget.exe`.

For complete information on `dotnet`, see [.NET Core command-line interface (CLI) tools](/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x).

## Package consumption

- [**dotnet add package**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package): Adds a package reference to the project file, then runs `dotnet restore` to install the package.
- [**dotnet remove package**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-remove-package): Removes a package reference from the project file.
- [**dotnet restore**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x): Restores the dependencies and tools of a project. As of NuGet 4.0, this runs the same code as `nuget restore`.
- [**dotnet nuget locals**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-locals): Lists locations of the *global-packages*, *http-cache*, and *temp* folders and clears the contents of those folders.

## Package creation

- [**dotnet pack**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-pack?tabs=netcore2x): Packs the code into a NuGet package. As of NuGet 4.0, this runs the same code as `nuget pack`.
- [**dotnet nuget push**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push): Pushes a package to a server and publishes it, applicable to nuget.org, Visual Studio Team Services, and third-party NuGet servers.
- [**dotnet nuget delete**](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-delete): Deletes or unlists a package from a host, applicable to nuget.org, Visual Studio Team Services, and third-party NuGet servers.

# Package references (PackageReference) in project files

Package references, using the `PackageReference` node, manage NuGet dependencies directly within project files (as opposed to a separate `packages.config` file). Using PackageReference, as it's called, doesn't affect other aspects of NuGet; for example, settings in `NuGet.Config` files (including package sources) are still applied as explained in [Configuring NuGet Behavior](configuring-nuget-behavior.md).

With PackageReference, you can also use MSBuild conditions to choose package references per target framework, configuration, platform, or other groupings. It also allows for fine-grained control over dependencies and content flow. (See For more details [NuGet pack and restore as MSBuild targets](../reference/msbuild-targets.md).)

By default, PackageReference is used for .NET Core projects, .NET Standard projects, and UWP projects targeting Windows 10 Build 15063 (Creators Update) and later, with the exception of C++ UWP projects. .NET full framework projects support PackageReference, but currently default to `packages.config`. To use PackageReference, migrate the dependencies from `packages.config` into your project file, then remove packages.config.

## Adding a PackageReference

Add a dependency in your project file using the following syntax:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0" />
    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## Controlling dependency version

The convention for specifying the version of a package is the same as when using `packages.config`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0" />
    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

In the example above, 3.6.0 means any version that is >=3.6.0 with preference for the lowest version, as described on [Package versioning](../reference/package-versioning.md#version-ranges-and-wildcards).

## Using PackageReference for a project with no PackageReferences
Advanced: If you have no packages installed in a project (no PackageReferences in project file and no packages.config file), but want the project to be restored as PackageReference style, you can set a Project property RestoreProjectStyle to PackageReference in your project file.
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <!--- ... -->
    <RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle>
    <!--- ... -->
</PropertyGroup>    
```
This may be useful, if you reference projects which are PackageReference styled (existing csproj or SDK-style projects). This will enable packages that those projects refer to, to be "transitively" referenced by your project.

## Floating Versions

[Floating versions](../consume-packages/dependency-resolution.md#floating-versions) are supported with `PackageReference`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0-beta*" />
    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## Controlling dependency assets

You might be using a dependency purely as a development harness and might not want to expose that to projects that will consume your package. In this scenario, you can use the `PrivateAssets` metadata to control this behavior.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->

    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>

    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

The following metadata tags control dependency assets:

| Tag | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IncludeAssets | These assets will be consumed | all |
| ExcludeAssets | These assets will not be consumed | none |
| PrivateAssets | These assets will be consumed but won't flow to the parent project | contentfiles;analyzers;build |

Allowable values for these tags are as follows, with multiple values separated by a semicolon except with `all` and `none` which must appear by themselves:

| Value | Description |
| --- | ---
| compile | Contents of the `lib` folder and controls whether your project can compile against the assemblies within the folder |
| runtime | Contents of the `lib` and `runtimes` folder and controls whether these assemblies will be copied out to the build output directory |
| contentFiles | Contents of the `contentfiles` folder |
| build | Props and targets in the `build` folder |
| analyzers | .NET analyzers |
| native | Contents of the `native` folder |
| none | None of the above are used. |
| all | All of the above (except `none`) |

In the following example, everything except the content files from the package would be consumed by the project and everything except content files and analyzers would flow to the parent project.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->

    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0">
        <IncludeAssets>all</IncludeAssets>
        <ExcludeAssets>contentFiles</ExcludeAssets>
        <PrivateAssets>contentFiles;analyzers</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>

    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

Note that because `build` is not included with `PrivateAssets`, targets and props *will* flow to the parent project. Consider, for example, that the reference above is used in a project that builds a NuGet package called AppLogger. AppLogger can consume the targets and props from `Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff`, as can projects that consume AppLogger.

## Adding a PackageReference condition

You can use a condition to control whether a package is included, where conditions can use any MSBuild variable or a variable defined in the targets or props file. However, at presently, only the `TargetFramework` variable is supported.

For example, say you're targeting `netstandard1.4` as well as `net452` but have a dependency that is applicable only for `net452`. In this case you don't want a `netstandard1.4` project that's consuming your package to add that unnecessary dependency. To prevent this, you specify a condition on the `PackageReference` as follows:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="9.0.1" Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net452'" />
    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```

A package built using this project will show that Newtonsoft.Json is included as a dependency only for a `net452` target:

Conditions can also be applied at the `ItemGroup` level and will apply to all children `PackageReference` elements:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition = "'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net452'">
    <!-- ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="9.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff" Version="3.6.0" />
    <!-- ... -->
</ItemGroup>
```
